Public place for hosting my test csv file

Intended to create a dashboard to visualize scraped data from BML Currency Exchange website.
Link to BML Exchange website: https://www.bankofmaldives.com.mv/exchange-rates

Created a seperate program to scrape data from website and save daily. It runs continuously and is designed to run once daily and add new data to the local csv file.
